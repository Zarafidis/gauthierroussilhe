# Gauthier Roussilhe's website

The website I developed using [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) for my good friend Gauthier Roussilhe.

This website intends to reduce its contribution to digital industry ecological footprint. Therefore the whole site and server services has been thought over and the average page size has been reduced to 450,56kb (Low tech, High future).
