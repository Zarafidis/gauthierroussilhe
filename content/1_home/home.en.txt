Bio: 

I’m a designer and researcher working on the effects of the Anthropocene, the recognition of the impact of human activities as one of the main drivers of Earth transformation and deterioration.

Consequently, I study how design practice can help negotiate the everyday life brought by our new living conditions and how to design and maintain services and systems with limited resources and energy for both humans and non-humans.

Through my professional practice I investigate on the field, I design mediums (filmmaking, motion graphics, digital media, cartographies) based on a low impact approach, I co-create and run workshops, I give talks and teach the next generation of designers about the new framework of their practice.

Box1: 

I. My work consists of:

1. Doing field research, interviews, translating the research back into understandable and sensible outcomes (films, objects, talks);
2. Conducting workshops to allow participants to imagine future everyday life (services, products, systems, craft) in a world with limited resources, energy and changed climate;
3. Providing content creation in filmmaking, motion graphics, digital media to answer communication needs based on a low-tech approach;
4. Giving talks and teaching the current and next generation of designers.

Box2: 

II. Who do I work with/for:

I work for / with people and organisations that have recognised the necessity of transition and are serious about making systemic changes. Thereby I intend to work mostly for public institutions, local councillors in towns and villages, NGOs, private organisations, think tanks and lobbies for transition, CSR and sustainibility management.

I have a particular interest into designing medium and experiences helping understand the effects of climate change and transition strategies to a broader audience.

III. We can collaborate if:

1. You want to imagine new ways of designing products / services / systems in a world with limited resources and energy;
2. You are interested in creating new imaginaries of a sustainable everyday life;
3. You want to engage with your citizens in a transition effort and you’re looking for new ways to foster public participation and commitment.
4. You are a design company or a design school trying to reframe their practice within the Anthropocene and the necessary transition.
