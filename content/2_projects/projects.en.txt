Title: Practice

My practice is based on the following principles:

1. Designing while acknowledging human activities as primary driver for climate breakdown;
2. Designing as a necessity of transition towards an Earth with limited resources and energy;
3. Designing is an act of radically reducing consumption of resources within existing systems:
   - generate systemic feedback loops that reduce consumption of resources and energy;
   - counteract with rebound effect that is generally embedded in contemporary design practice;
4. Designing is an act of engaging as less resources as possible while aiming for a maximum “transition effect”;
5. Designing as territory-centred practice (ecosystems, human and non-human communities, climat factors; capabilities and limits);
6. Putting design into politics as an act of negotiating collective habitability of the world;
7. Designing as an economical act of anticipating externalities and thus the real cost of what it puts into the world.
